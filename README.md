# **Portfolio Optimization with Stochastic Programming**

## **Overview**
This project implements portfolio optimization using stochastic programming, a powerful technique that incorporates future uncertainty into decision-making. By generating multiple potential scenarios, the model helps construct portfolios that can withstand unexpected market fluctuations, making it highly applicable in today's volatile financial environment.

## **why this Project: Volatility in Financial Markets and the Need for Robust Portfolio Management**

In 2020, the financial world faced one of the most volatile periods in recent history due to the global pandemic. Stock markets saw unprecedented levels of uncertainty as lockdowns, government interventions, and changing consumer behaviors drastically impacted financial performance. Many investors, from retail traders to large institutions, experienced heavy losses as traditional portfolio management strategies struggled to cope with the extreme market volatility.

During this time, it became clear that relying solely on historical data and static optimization models was insufficient for managing portfolios under such uncertain conditions. Traditional techniques like Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) were not designed to account for the rapid changes and unpredictable shocks to the market. This left investors vulnerable to unforeseen risks and black swan events.

**This project was born from the need to explore better ways to incorporate future uncertainty into portfolio construction.** By leveraging **stochastic programming** and **Monte Carlo simulations**, this approach generates multiple possible future market scenarios, allowing investors to build portfolios that are more resilient to unexpected events.

### Key Features:
- **Scenario Generation**: Uses Monte Carlo simulations to generate thousands of potential future market outcomes based on historical data.
- **Risk Management**: Incorporates advanced risk management techniques, including scenario-based constraints and Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Implements a stochastic programming model that maximizes expected return while minimizing risk across various market scenarios.
- **Robust to Volatility**: Designed to help investors build portfolios that can better navigate periods of extreme market volatility and uncertainty.
